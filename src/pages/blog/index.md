# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I will be blogging to learn languages such as English, Haskell, Python, Rust or Zig. My primary programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript, but I want to learn more languages, whether itâ€™s scripting languages or native programming languages, or even spoken languages (like English).

Sometimes I may write some code blocks to showcase some inspiration.

- English

```
Hello World!
```

- JavaScript/TypeScript

```ts
console.log('Hello World!')
```

- Haskell

```hs
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

- Python

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

- Rust

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!")
}
```

- Zig

```zig
const print = @import("std").debug.print;

pub fn main() void {
    print("Hello, world!\n", .{});
}
```
