# README

My primary programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript, but I want to learn more languages, whether itâ€™s scripting languages or native programming languages, or even spoken languages (like English).

Sometimes I may write some code blocks to showcase some inspiration.

## Some Language

- English

```plaintext
ok!
```

- JavaScript/TypeScript

```ts
console.log('ok!')
```

- Python

```py
print('ok!')
```

- Haskell

```hs
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "ok!"
```

- Rust

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("ok!")
}
```

- Zig

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    std.debug.print("ok!\n", .{});
}
```
